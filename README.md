# Hangman Game in Python

This project is a Python-based **Hangman Game** where a word is randomly selected by the system from a predefined word list. The game provides the following features:

- **Hint System**: 1 to 3 letters of the word are randomly revealed, with the remaining letters represented by hyphens (`-`).
- **Guessing Mechanism**: Players guess the word by suggesting one letter at a time.
- **Attempts**: Each player has 6 attempts. If a guessed letter is correct, the number of attempts remains the same. If the guess is incorrect, 1 attempt is deducted.

Test your vocabulary skills and have fun with this classic word-guessing game!
